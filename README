  Summary:
    A web-based project management and development environment written in PHP.
	- Full authentication system.
	- User access rights to restrict specific areas.
	- Projects module provides a means to create and manage several different
	projects.
	- Teams module provides a means for several sub-groups or development
	teams within a project.
	- Tasks can be assigned (or unassigned) per team.
	- File manager module lets users upload/download/edit files in their
	project.
	- Agenda includes a calendar and events that can be created/deleted/edited
	easily.

	- Each project has their own links section where important links can be
	added for the rest of the project developers.
	- Each user has their own bookmarks section where they can add/delete
